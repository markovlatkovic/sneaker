# Laravel Exception Notifications

An easy way to send emails whenever an exception occurs on server for Laravel Applications.

## Install

### Install via composer

```
$ composer require squareboat/sneaker dev-master
```

or

Add dependency to your `composer.json` file and run composer update.

```
require: {
    "squareboat/sneaker": "dev-master"
}
```

### Configure Laravel

Once installation operation is complete, simply add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```
Squareboat\Sneaker\SneakerServiceProvider::class,
```


### Add Sneaker's Exception Capturing

Add exception capturing to `App/Exceptions/Handler.php`:

```php
public function report(Exception $e)
{
    app('sneaker')->captureException($e);

    parent::report($e);
}
```

### Configuration File

Create the Sneaker configuration file  with this command:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Squareboat\Sneaker\SneakerServiceProvider"
```

The config file will be published in  `config/sneaker.php`

Following are the configuration attributes used for the sneaker.

#### silent

The package comes with `'silent' => true,` configuration by default, since you probably don't want error emailing enabled on your development environment. Especially if you've set `'debug' => true,`.

For sending emails when an exception occurs set `SNEAKER_SILENT=false` in your `.env` file.


#### capture

By default package has included `Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\FatalErrorException::class`.

#### to
